# CalculatorPy

This won't be updated, it is an old school project.  Some of the code is 'badly' done cause I was lazy and didn't want to implement a proper parser, if you want to find a proper parser look either at DOML, or at Porc-C (the latter isn't yet public but will be sometime soon).  Just uses an absolute metric tonne of regex, so you may have to read up on that.  This also requires wx to be installed for it to work, instructions are in the pdf.
